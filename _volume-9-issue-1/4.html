abstract: "We implemented two new models for star formation and supernova feedback into the astrophysical code Enzo. These models are designed to efficiently capture the bulk properties of galaxies and the influence of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Unlike Enzo's existing models, these do not track stellar populations over time with computationally expensive particle objects. Instead, supernova explosions immediately follow stellar birth and their feedback is deposited in a volumetric manner. Our models were tested using simulations of Milky Way-like isolated galaxies, and we found that neither model was able to produce a realistic, metal-enriched CGM. Our work suggests that volumetric feedback models are not sufficient replacements for particle-based star formation and feedback models."
