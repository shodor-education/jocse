  <h2>Introduction from the Editor-in-Chief</h2>
  <p>
    Computational science is an increasingly important interdisciplinary field
    as scientists, engineers, and social scientists apply modeling and
    simulation techniques to gain insights on the behavior of complex systems,
    accelerate the rate of discovery, and design new approaches to a variety of
    problems. Modeling has become the third approach to scientific advancement
    along with theory and experimentation. As a result, an increasing number of
    institutions have begun academic programs in computational science ranging
    from minor and certificate programs for undergraduates to specialized
    undergraduate and graduate degree programs. At the same time, the
    inquiry-based approach to computational science is helping to reform the
    approach to instruction at both the university and K-12 levels. This
    approach engages students in the learning process and helps them to
    understand both the basic and more advanced concepts in mathematics and
    science by providing real-world examples and visualizations of the nature
    and form of those relationships.

  <p>
    The Journal of Computational Science Education is intended to provide an
    outlet for high quality papers describing successful computational science
    instructional materials and projects and research on the efficacy of
    instruction with computational science. Articles will be accepted from
    faculty describing instructional materials and/or the impacts of those
    materials on student learning and from students presenting successful
    projects and their assessment of what was learned.
  </p>

    We have assembled an editorial board of scientists, mathematicians, and
    engineers with a broad array of experiences from their own disciplines. They
    will lead the peer review process for journal submissions. If you have the
    background and experience to be a reviewer for the journal, we encourage you
    to <a href="{{ 'volunteer' | relative_url }}">volunteer to do so</a>. We
    hope the review process will provide an incentive for faculty who have been
    using computational science to share their classroom successes and will also
    encourage other faculty to devote some additional time to the development of
    such materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope you will take time to read the journal and to participate as an
    author or reviewer. We welcome suggestions that will help us to improve the
    journal and make it of greatest benefit to the computational science
    community.
