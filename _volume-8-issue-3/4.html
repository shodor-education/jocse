abstract: "We present results and lessons learned from a 2015-2016 Blue Waters Student Internship. The project was to perform preliminary simulations of an astrophysics application, Black Widow binary systems, with the adaptive-mesh simulation code Castro. The process involved updating the code as needed to run on Blue Waters, constructing initial conditions, and performing scaling tests exploring Castro's hybrid message passing/threaded architecture."
