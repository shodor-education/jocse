abstract: "\"Aligning SequencesSequentially and Concurrently,\"  an educational computational science module by the authors and available online, develops a sequential algorithm to determine the highest similarity score and the alignments that yield this score for two DNA sequences.  Moreover, the module considers several approaches to parallelization and speedup.  Besides a serial implementation in C, a parallel program in C/MPI is available.  This paper describes the module and details experiences using the material in a bioinformatics course at University \"Magna Graecia\" of Catanzaro, Italy.  Besides being appropriate for such a course, the module can provide a meaningful application for a high performance computing or a data structures class."
