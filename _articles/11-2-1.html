abstract: "The central dogma is a key foundational concept in biochemistry. The idea that DNA mutations cause change at the protein level can be abstract for students. To provide a real-world example of the effect of mutation on protein function, a molecular visualization module was developed and incorporated into two biochemistry courses. This inquiry-based activity explored the molecular basis and cultural relevance of sickle cell anemia. Hemoglobin structural changes from the disease were examined. Participants used free tools including NCBI, RCSB PDB, LALIGN and Swiss PDB DeepView protein visualization software from EXPASY. This module was an active, engaging exercise which exposed students to protein visualization and increased cultural awareness."
