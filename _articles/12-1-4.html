abstract: "The main objective of computer graphics is to effectively depict an image in a virtual scene in its realistic form within a reasonable amount of time. This paper discusses two different ray tracing techniques and the performance evaluation of the serial and parallel implementation of ray tracing, which in its serial form is known to be computationally intensive and costly for previous computers. The parallel implementation was achieved using OpenMP with C++, and the maximum speedup was ten times that of the serial implementation. The experiment in this paper can be used to teach high-performance computing students the benefits of multi-threading in computationally intensive algorithms and the benefits of parallel programming."
