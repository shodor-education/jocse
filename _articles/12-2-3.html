abstract: "Interaction is the key to making education more engaging. Effective interaction is difficult enough to achieve in a live classroom, and it is extremely challenging in a virtual environment. To keep the degree of instruction and learning at the levels our students have come to expect, additional efforts are required to focus efforts on other facets to motivate learning, whether the learning is relative to students in our academic courses, student internship programs, Summer Institute Series, or NSF/TACC's Frontera Fellowship Program. We focus our efforts in lecturing less and interacting more."
