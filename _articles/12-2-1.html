abstract: "DeapSECURE is a non-degree computational training program that provides a solid high-performance computing (HPC) and big-data foundation for cybersecurity students. DeapSECURE consists of six modules covering a broad spectrum of topics such as HPC platforms, big-data analytics, machine learning, privacy-preserving methods, and parallel programming. In the second year of this program, to improve the learning experience, we implemented a number of changes, such as grouping modules into two broad categories, \"big-data\" and \"HPC\"; creating a single cybersecurity storyline across the modules; and introducing post-workshop (optional) \"hackshops.\" Two major goals of these changes are, firstly, to effectively engage students to maintain high interest and attendance in such a non-degree program, and, secondly, to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. To assess the program, and in particular the changes made in the second year, we evaluated and compared the execution and outcomes of the training in Year 1 and Year 2. The assessment data shows that the implemented changes have partially achieved our goals, while simultaneously providing indications where we can further improve. The development of a fully on-line training mode is planned for the next year, along with a reproducibility pilot study to broaden the subject domain from cybersecurity to other areas, such as computations with sensitive data."
