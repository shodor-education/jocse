abstract: "In this paper, we present GalaxSeeHPC, a new cluster-enabled
gravitational N-Body program designed for educational use, along
with two potential student experiences that illustrate what students
might be able to investigate at larger N than available with earlier
versions of GalaxSee. GalaxSeeHPC adds additional force
calculation algorithms and input options to the previous clusterenabled
version. GalaxSeeHPC lessons have been developed
focusing on two key studies, the structure of rotating galaxies and
the large scale structure of the universe. At large N, visualizing
the results becomes a significant challenge, and tools for
visualization are presented. The canonical lesson in the original
version of GalaxSee is the rotation and flattening of a cluster with
angular momentum. Model discrepancies that are not obvious at
the range of N available in previous versions become quite
obvious at large N, and changes to the initial mass and velocity
distribution can be seen more readily. For the large scale structure
models, while basic clearing and clustering can be seen at around
N=5,000, N=50,000 allows for a much clearer visualization of the
filamentary structure at large scale, and N=500,000 allows for a
more detailed geometry of the knots formed as the filaments
combine to form superclusters. For the galactic dynamics
simulations, we found that while a flattening due to overall
angular momentum can be explored with N=1,000 or smaller,
formation of spiral structure requires not only a larger number of
objects, typically on the order of 10,000, but also modifications to
the default initial mass and velocity distributions used in older
versions of GalaxSee."
