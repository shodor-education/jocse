abstract: "This paper explores the landscape of computing educational resources found on the web together with teaching and learning materials that can facilitate the integration of computational thinking into the classroom. In specific, this paper focuses in finding and describing existing learning environments that integrate computational thinking into a STEM discipline This study provides initial steps towards that goal of providing a comprehensive list of STEM-based computational resources on the web that also provides guiding information, which can help teachers and parents make decisions to evaluate and integrate these resources easily for educational purposes."
