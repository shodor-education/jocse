abstract: "From 2013 to 2018 the University of Virginia operated a summer school and internship program in partnership with NASA. The goal was to improve the software skills of students in environmental and earth sciences and to introduce them to high-performance computing. In this paper, we describe the program and discuss its evolution in response to student needs and changes in the high-performance computing landscape. The future direction for the summer school and plans for the materials developed are also discussed."
