abstract: "A computational module has been developed in which students
examine the binding interactions between indinavir and HIV-1
protease. The project is a component of the Medicinal Chemistry
course offered to upper level chemistry, biochemistry, and biology
majors. Students work with modeling and informatics tools utilized
in drug development research while evaluating wild-type
and mutated forms of the HIV-1 protease in complex with the
inhibitor indinavir. By quantifying the molecular interactions
within protease-inhibitor complexes, students can characterize the
structural basis for reduced efficacy of indinavir."
