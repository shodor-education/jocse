abstract: "There are numerous reports documenting the critical need for high performance computing infrastructure to advance discovery in all fields of study. The Blue Waters project was funded by the National Science Foundation to address this need and provide leading edge petascale computing resources to advance research and scholarship. There are also numerous reports that identify the lack of an adequate workforce capable of utilizing and advancing petascale class computing infrastructure well into the future. From the outset, the Blue Waters project has responded to this critical need by conducting national scale workforce development activities to prepare a larger and more diverse workforce. This paper describes those activities as exemplars for adoption and replication by the community."
