abstract: "In this paper, we model the growth of virus in an infected person, taking into account the effect of antibiotics and immunity of the person. We use discrete dynamical systems or difference equations to model the situation; and Excel to obtain the numerical solutions and visualize the solution using graphing capabilities of Excel."
