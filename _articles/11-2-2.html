abstract: "A number of efforts have been made to introduce computational science in the undergraduate curriculum. We describe a survey of the undergraduate computational science programs in the U.S. The programs face several challenges including student recruitment and limited faculty participation in the programs. We describe the current state of the programs, discuss the problems they face, and discuss potential short- and long-range strategies that might address those challenges."
