abstract: "Geoscience educators in K&ndash;12 have limited experience with the quantitative methods used by professionals as part of their everyday work.  Many science teachers at this level have backgrounds in other science fields.  Even those with geoscience or environmental science backgrounds have limited experience with applying modeling and simulation tools to introduce realworld activities into their classrooms.  This article summarizes a project aimed at introducing K&ndash;12 geoscience teachers to project based exercises using urban hydrology models that can be integrated into their classroom teaching.  The impact of teacher workshops on teacher's confidence and willingness to utilize computer modeling in their classes is also reported."
