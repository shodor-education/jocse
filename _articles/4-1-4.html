abstract: "Undergraduate teaching that focuses on student-driven research, mentored by research active faculty, can have a powerful effect in bringing relevance and cohesiveness to a department's programs. We describe and discuss such a program in computational mathematics, and the effects this program has had on the students, the faculty, the department and the university."
