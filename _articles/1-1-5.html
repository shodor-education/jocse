abstract: "For the Blue Waters Undergraduate Petascale Education Program
(NSF), we developed two computational science modules,
\"Biofilms: United They Stand, Divided They Colonize\" and
\"Getting the 'Edge' on the Next Flu Pandemic: We Should'a 'Node'
Better.\" This paper describes the modules and details our
experiences using them in three courses during the 2009-2010
academic year at Wofford College. These courses, from three
programs, included students from several majors: biology,
chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and
undecided. Each course was evaluated by the students and
instructors, and many of their suggestions have already been
incorporated into the modules."
