abstract: "This paper describes introducing rate of change and systems modeling paradigms and software as tools to increase appreciation for computational science.  A similar approach was used with three different audiences: freshman liberal arts majors, junior math education majors, and college faculty teaching introductory science courses.  A description of the implementation used with each audience and their reactions to the material is discussed, along with some example problems that could be used in a variety of courses."
