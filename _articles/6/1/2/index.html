abstract: "In the authors' experience the languages available for teaching
introductory computer programming courses are lacking.  In practice,
they violate some of the fundamentals taught in an introductory
course.  This is often the case, for example, with I/O.  Picky is
a new open source programming language created specifically for
education that enables the students to program according to the
principles laid down in class.  It solves a number of issues the
authors had to face while teaching introductory courses for several
years in other languages.  The language is small, simple and very
strict regarding what is a legal program. It has a terse syntax and
it is strongly typed and very restrictive.  Both the compiler and
the runtime include extra checks to provide safety features.  The
compiler generates byte-code for compatibility and the programming
tools are freely available for Linux, MacOSX, Plan 9 from Bell Labs
and Windows.  This paper describes the language and discusses the
motivation to implement it and its main educational features."
