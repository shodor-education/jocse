abstract: "We attempted to find a more sustainable solution for performing virtual screening with AutoDock Vina which uses less electricity than computers using typical x64 CPUs.  We tested a cluster of ODROID-XU3 Lite computers with ARM CPUs and compared its performance to a server with x64 CPUs.  In order to be a viable solution, our cluster needed to perform the screen without sacrificing speed or increasing hardware costs.  The cluster completed the virtual screen in a little less time than our comparison server while using just over half the electricity that the server used.  Additionally, the hardware for the cluster cost about 38% less than the server, making it a viable solution."
