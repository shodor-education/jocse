abstract: "In this paper, we present a computational approach to teaching general education courses that expose students to science and computing principles in engaging contexts, including modeling and simulation, games, and history. The courses use scalable curriculum modules organized in layers of increasing difficulties in order to balance learning challenges and student abilities. We describe the computational pedagogy followed in these modules and courses, with particular attention to the simulation-based course, namely introduction to computational science, to present a case study for those considering similar initiatives."
