abstract: "HPC and Scientific Computing are integral tools for sustaining the growth of scientific research. Additionally, educating future domain scientists and research-focused IT staff about the use of computation to support research is as important as capital expenditures on new resources. The aim of this paper it to describe the parallel computing portion of Purdue University's HPC seminar series which is used as a tool to introduce students from many non-traditional disciplines to scientific, parallel and high-performance computing."
