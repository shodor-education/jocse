abstract: "For the past thirteen years, Los Alamos National Laboratory HPC Division has hosted the Computer System, Cluster and Networking Summer Institute summer internship program (recently renamed "The Supercomputer Institute") to provide a basis is cluster computing for undergraduate and graduate students. The institute invites 12 students each year to participate in a 10-week internship program. This program has been a strong educational experience for many students through this time, and has been an important recruitment tool for HPC Division. In this paper, we describe the institute as a whole and dive into individual components that were changed this year to keep the program up to date. We also provide some qualitative and quantitative results that indicate that these changes have improved the program over recent years."
