abstract: "Establishing consistent use of computer models and simulations in K-12 classrooms has been a challenge for the computational science education community.  Scaling successful local efforts has been particularly difficult. In this article we describe how a training model from one place and time can be translated into a training model for another very different place and time if critical factors such as school system culture, professional development organization, local learning standards and goals, and collaboration between STEM disciplines are taken into account."
