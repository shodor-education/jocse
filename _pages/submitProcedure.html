    The Journal of Computational Science Education is intended to provide an
    outlet for high quality papers describing successful computational science
    instructional materials and projects and research on the efficacy of
    instruction with computational science. Articles will be accepted from
    faculty describing instructional materials and/or the impacts of those
    materials on student learning and from students presenting successful
    projects and their assessment of what was learned.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regular articles should describe the implementation of a computational
    science program, project, approach, or exercise that has been used in a
    formal or informal educational setting. The article should also provide
    results of a formal or informal evaluation of the experience that could
    take several forms. A formal assessment might involve the evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the learning materials based on quantitative measurements
    of achievement or observations of learning behaviors. Less formal
    evaluations could include reflections on the success of the experience based
    on teacher or student journal entries about the experience, discussions of
    any technical problems or innovations, quantitative or qualitative analysis
    of student learning and/or attitudes, or reflections on the causes of
    successes or problems with the approach. Articles will be judged relative to
    the originality of the learning materials, approach to instruction, evidence
    of success, and potential importance of the information to the computational
    science education community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Student papers should summarize the purpose and results of a computational
    science project undertaken by one or more students. Those papers should
    describe the project in terms of the underlying science and engineering
    principles and the nature of the problem, the approach taken to solve that
    problem, and project results. Student papers should also reflect on the
    experience including such things as project organization, challenges, and
    solutions as well as the impact of the project on the students' education
    and career outlook.

  <h2>Submission Format</h2>
  <p>
    All submissions should be in the form of a paper with attached interactive
    materials (software, spreadsheets, interactive workbooks, or other
    materials) and photo quality graphics. The paper should be submitted both as
    a PDF file and in raw form (both Word and LaTeX accepted). The format of the
    paper should follow the guidelines included in the following templates:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ 'downloads/JOCSE_Word_Template.zip' | relative_url }}">Word
        Template</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ 'downloads/JOCSE_LaTeX_Template.zip' | relative_url }}">LaTeX
        Template</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The attached materials should be packaged in either a zip or tarball
    (tar+gzip) format, with the extensions .zip and .tgz respectively. File
    names for all files should be in the form of the first author's last name,
    followed by the year. If multiple submissions are made in the same year,
    additional submissions should add .a, .b, .c or further letter
    distinguishing it from previous submissions. (e.g. all files submitted by
    David Joiner for a third submission in 2009 would be in the format
    joiner_2009_c.pdf, joiner_2009_c.tex, joiner_2009_c.m, joiner_2009_c_1.eps,
    joiner_2009_c_2.eps, etc.) The paper should be between 5 and 15 pages in
    length, unless prior approval from JOCSE has been obtained. Student papers
    should be identified as such by preceding the title of the paper with the
    phrase 'STUDENT PAPER:'. This will be removed in the final formatting
    process if the paper is accepted for publication.
  </p>
  <p>
    All papers, exercises, and programs will be subject to
    <a href="{{ 'reviewProcess' | relative_url }}">VV&amp;A review</a>, authors
    are highly encouraged to include their own VV&amp;A results as a section in
    their paper. Keywords should be adequate to assign a reviewer and to make
    the article discoverable in search.
  </p>

  <h2>Review Procedure</h2>
  <p>
    An editor will be assigned to the submission based on content area, and the
    editor will make an initial decision based on appropriateness of the
    material to either submit to full review or reject based on
    inappropriateness to the publication or failure to adhere to the submission
    format. Once assigned to a reviewer or reviewers, the submission will
    undergo review according to the
    <a href="{{ 'reviewProcess' | relative_url }}">VV&amp;A process</a> in place
    at the Computational Science Education Reference Desk (CSERD). Additionally,
    a recommendation to accept, accept with minor revisions, reject with
    resubmission recommended, or reject with resubmission not recommended will
    be made and the author will be informed of the editor's decision. Criteria
    for acceptance is that the submission should include either a unique use of
    computation in the classroom or a unique research finding in computational
    science education, that it should pass CSERD's
    <a href="{{ 'reviewProcess' | relative_url }}">VV&amp;A review</a>, that it
    is viewed as valuable to the community, and that there be space available in
    an upcoming issue.
