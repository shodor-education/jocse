abstract: "The Cyberinfrastructure Security Education for Professionals and Students (CiSE-ProS) virtual reality environment is an exploratory project that uses engaging approaches to evaluate the impact of learning environments produced by augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies for teaching cybersecurity concepts. The program is steeped in well-reviewed pedagogy; the refinement of the educational methods based on constant assessment is a critical factor that has contributed to its success. In its current implementation, the program supports undergraduate student education. The overarching goal is to develop the CiSE-ProS VR program for implementation at institutions with low cyberinfrastructure adoption where students may not have access to a physical data center to learn about the physical aspects of cybersecurity."
