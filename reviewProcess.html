  <p>
    VV&amp;A reviews, or verification, validation, and accreditation reviews,
    are a more structured way of reviewing the information on JOCSE. This type
    of review proves most helpful when examining the "usability" of an item.
    Someone looking through can clearly see any errors, problems, drawbacks, or
    strong points of the material. The reason this can be done so clearly is the
    information input in these reviews is all formatted to allow for quick,
    efficient, and yet in-depth reviews.

  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>
    Verification is the demonstration that the model is logically correct and
    follows from the physical and mathematical laws used. For a computer
    simulation, verification shows that the specifications are fulfilled and
    that the model will run on the computer system of the educator and student
    as specified. Scientists and technologists will be involved in the
    verification review process however even someone totally unfamiliar with the
    information the material covers can supply verification information.
    Verification includes things based on how the material displays, if at all.
    If on a computer with a certain browser and a certain platform a model
    cannot be displayed, a verification review along with a bug submission would
    help resolve the issue. Additionally, if the directions are not easy to
    follow or are ambiguous and confusing to follow, a verification review would
    be the best thing to submit. In some cases people that know nothing about
    the material are the best people to fill out verification reviews since
    scientists and technicians rarely need the directions to figure out how to
    use a tool.

<section id="validation-section">
  <h2>Validation</h2>
  <p>
    Validation is the demonstration that the model correctly predicts the
    phenomena modeled. This ensures that the model is based on good scientific
    methods and principles. This type of review should be submitted by those who
    are very familiar with the science behind the material, since they will be
    asked on what scientific facts, theories, equations, or findings they are
    basing their observations.

<section id="accreditation-section">
  <h2>Accreditation</h2>
  <p>
    Accreditation is the act of showing that the educational purpose of the
    model or simulation is achieved. This includes relating the object to the
    K-12 standards, identifying assessment criteria, and grade level. Educators
    will be involved in the review process. Who is the information useful for?
    What field of math, science, or technology would the material fall under?
    How should the information be used and applied to aid in learning? These,
    and other such questions are answered in the Accreditation portion of the
    review. Although reviewers choosing to submit an Accreditation review should
    be familiar with the material, it is more vital that they have experience in
    applying material in an educational setting so they know when information is
    useful and applicable, and when it is not.
