abstract: "It is with great pleasure that we release the first issue of the Journal of Computational Science Education.  The journal is intended as an outlet for those teaching or learning computational science to share their best practices and experiences with the community.  Included are examples of programs and exercises that have been used effectively in the classroom to teach computational science concepts and practices, assessments of the impact of computational science education on learning outcomes in science and engineering fields, and the experiences of students who have completed significant computational science projects.  With a peer-reviewed journal, we hope to provide a compendium of the best practices in computational science education along with links to shareable educational materials and assessments."
