abstract: "We have developed a series of course-based undergraduateresearch experiences for students integrated into coursecurriculum centered around the use of 3D visualization andvirtual reality for science visualization. One project involves thecreation and use of a volumetric renderer for hyperstack images,paired with a biology project in confocal microscopy. Studentshave worked to develop and test VR enabled tools for confocalmicroscopy visualization across headset based and CAVE basedVR platforms. Two applications of the tool are presented: arendering of Drosophila primordial germ cells coupled withautomated detection and counting, and a database in developmentof 3D renderings of pollen grains. Another project involves thedevelopment and testing of point cloud renderers. Student workhas focused on performance testing and enhancement across arange of 2D and 3D hardware, including native Quest apps.Through the process of developing these tools, students areintroduced to scientific visualization concepts, while gainingpractical experience with programming, software engineering,graphics, shader programming, and cross-platform design."
