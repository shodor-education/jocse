abstract: "Throughout the cyberinfrastructure community there are a largerange of resources available to train faculty and young scholarsabout successful utilization of computational resources for research.The challenge that the community faces is that training materialsabound, but they can be difficult to find, and often have littleinformation about the quality or relevance of offerings. Buildingon existing software technology, we propose to build a way forthe community to better share and find training and educationmaterials through a federated training repository. In this scenario,organizations and authors retain physical and legal ownership oftheir materials by sharing only catalog information, organizationscan refine local portals to use the best and most appropriate materialsfrom both local and remote sources, and learners can takeadvantage of materials that are reviewed and described more clearly.In this paper, we introduce the HPC ED pilot project, a federatedtraining repository that is designed to allow resource providers,campus portals, schools, and other institutions to both incorporatetraining from multiple sources into their own familiar interfacesand to publish their local training materials."
