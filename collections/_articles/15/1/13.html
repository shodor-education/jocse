abstract: "In this paper, we present an approach to hands-on HighPerformance Computing (HPC) System Administrator training thatis not reliant on high performance computing infrastructure. Weintroduce a scalable, standalone virtual 3-node OpenHPC-basedtraining lab designed for Resource Constrained Environments(RCEâ€™s) that runs on a participant's local computer. We describethe technical components and implementation of the virtual HPCtraining lab and address the principles and best practices consideredthroughout the design of the training material."
