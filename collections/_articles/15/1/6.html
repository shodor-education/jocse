abstract: "The HPC Carpentry lesson program is a highly interactive, handsonapproach to getting users up to speed on HPC cluster systems. Itis motivated by the increasing availability of cluster resources to awide range of user groups, many of whom come from communitiesthat have not traditionally used HPC systems. We adopt the Carpentriesapproach to pedagogy, which consists of a workshop settingwhere learners type along with instructors while working throughthe instructional steps, building up 'muscle memory' of the tasks,further reinforced by challenge exercises at critical points withinthe lesson. This paper reviews the development of the HPC CarpentryLesson Program as it becomes the first entrant into phase 2of The Carpentries Lesson Program Incubator. This incubator is thepathway for HPC Carpentry to become an official lesson programof The Carpentries."
