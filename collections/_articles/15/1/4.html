abstract: "High-performance computing (HPC) is an important tool for research,development, and the industry. Moreover, with the recentexpansion of machine learning applications, the need for HPC isincreasing even further. However, in developing countries withlimited access to the HPC ecosystem, the lack of infrastructure,expertise, and access to knowledge represents a major obstacle tothe expansion of HPC. Under these constraints, the adoption ofHPC by communities presents several challenges. The HPC SummerSchools are an initiative of CyberColombia that has taken placeover the past 5 years. It aims to develop the critical skills, strategicplanning, and networking required to make available, disseminate,and maintain the knowledge of high-performance computing andits applications in Colombia. Here we report the results of thisseries of Summer Schools. The events have proven to be successful,with over 200 participants from more than 20 institutions. Participantsspan different levels of expertise, including undergraduateand graduate students as well as professionals. We also describesuccessful use cases for HPC cloud solutions, namely ChameleonCloud."
