abstract: "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is a long-standing leader inresearch and development of high-performance computing (HPC)in the pursuit of science. However, we face daunting challengesin fostering a robust and diverse HPC workforce. 
Basic HPC is not typically taught at early stages of students' academic careers,and the capacity and knowledge of HPC at many institutions arelimited. Even so, such topics are prerequisites for advanced trainingprograms, internships, graduate school, and ultimately for careersin HPC. To help address this challenge, as part of the DOE ExascaleComputing Project's Broadening Participation Initiative, werecently launched the Introduction to HPC Training and WorkforcePipeline Program to provide accessible introductory material onHPC, scalable AI, and analytics.We describe the Intro to HPC Bootcamp, an immersive programdesigned to engage students from underrepresented groups as theylearn foundational HPC skills. The program takes a novel 
approach to HPC training by turning the traditional curriculum upside down.Instead of focusing on technology and its applications, the bootcampfocuses on energy justice to motivate the training of HPCskills through project-based pedagogy and real-life science stories.Additionally, the bootcamp prepares students for internships andfuture careers at DOE labs. The first bootcamp, hosted by the advancedcomputing facilities at Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, andOak Ridge National Labs and organized by Sustainable HorizonsInstitute, took place in August 2023."
