abstract: "The Data-Enabled Advanced Computational Training Program forCybersecurity Research and Education (DeapSECURE) is a nondegreetraining consisting of six modules covering a broad range ofcyberinfrastructure techniques, including high performance computing,big data, machine learning and advanced cryptography,aimed at reducing the gap between current cybersecurity curriculaand requirements needed for advanced research and industrialprojects. Since 2020, these lesson modules have been updated andretooled to suit fully-online delivery. Hands-on activities were reformattedto accommodate self-paced learning. In this paper, we summarizethe four years of the project comparing in-person and onlineonly instruction methods as well as outlining lessons learned.The module content and hands-on materials are being releasedas open-source educational resources. We also indicate our futuredirection to scale up and increase adoption of the DeapSECUREtraining program to benefit cybersecurity research everywhere."
