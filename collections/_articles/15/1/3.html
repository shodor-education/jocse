abstract: "The convergence of quantum technologies and high-performancecomputing offers unique opportunities for research and algorithmdevelopment, demanding a skilled workforce to harness the quantumsystems' potential. In this lightning talk, we address the growingneed to train experts in quantum computing and explore thechallenges in training these individuals in quantum computing,including the abstract nature of quantum theory, or the focus onspecific frameworks. To overcome these obstacles, we propose selfguidedlearning resources that offer interactive learning experiencesand practical framework-independent experimentation for differenttarget audiences."
