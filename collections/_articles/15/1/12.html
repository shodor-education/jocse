abstract: "Students in community colleges are either interested in a quickdegree or a skill that allows them to hop onto a career area whileminimizing debt. Attending a four-year university can be achallenge for financial costs or academic reasons, and acceptancecan be competitive. Today's job market is challenging in hiring andretaining diverse staff. More so within the High PerformanceComputing (HPC) or a government laboratory. Industry offershigher salaries, potentially better benefits, or opportunities forremote work, factors that contribute to the challenge of attractingtalent. At the National Energy Research Scientific ComputingCenter (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, sitereliability engineers manage the HPC data center onsite 24x7. Thefacility is a unique and complex ecosystem that needs to bemonitored in addition to the normal areas such as the computationalsystems, the three-tier storage, the supporting infrastructure, thenetwork and cybersecurity. Effective monitoring requires theunderstanding of data collected from the heterogeneous sourcesproduced by the systems and facility. With so much data, it is mucheasier to view the data in graphic format and NERSC uses Grafanato display their data. To encourage interest in HPC, NERSCpartnered with Laney College to create a Data Analytics Program.Once Laney faculty learns how to teach the classes toward acertificate program, they fill a need for their students to build theskill in data analytics toward a career or to continue toward a fouryeardegree as transfer students. This also fills a gap where thenearby four-year university has a long waitlist. This paper describeshow NERSC partners with to create a pipeline toward a dataanalytics career."
