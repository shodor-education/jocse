abstract: "The Cross-Institutional Research Engagement Network (CIREN)is a collaborative project between the University of Tennessee,Knoxville (UTK) and Arizona State University (ASU). Thisproject's purpose is to fill critical gaps in the development andretention of cyberinfrastructure (CI) facilitators via training,mentorship, and research engagement. Research engagementsinclude projects at the CI facilitator's local institution, betweenCIREN partner institutions, and through NSF's ACCESSprogram. This lightning talk will detail the training curriculumand mentorship activities the project has implemented in its firstyear as well as plans for its future research engagements.Feedback is welcome from the community with respect to projectdirections, best practices, and challenges experienced inimplementing this or similar programs at academic institutions."
