abstract: "The 'Understanding the Skills and Pathways Behind Research SoftwareTraining' BoF session run at ISC'23 provided an opportunityto bring together a group of attendees interested in approachesto enhance skills within the Research Software Engineering community.This included looking at options for understanding anddeveloping pathways that practitioners can follow to develop theirskills and competencies in a structured manner from beginner toadvanced level. Questions discussed included: How can we highlightthe existence of different training opportunities and ensureawareness and uptake? What materials already exist and whatâ€™smissing? How do we navigate this largely undefined landscape? Inshort: how does one train to become an RSE?One of the interactive parts of this session was based arounda live, anonymous survey. Participants were asked a number ofquestions ranging from their role in the training community tohow easy they feel it is to find/access training content targetingdifferent skill levels. They were also asked about challenges faced inaccessing relevant content, combining it into a coherent pathway,and linking training content from different sources. Other questionsfocused on discoverability of material and skills that are mostcommonly overlooked. The number of respondents and responsesvaried between questions, with 24 to 50 participants engaging andproviding 32 to 59 replies.The goal of this lightning talk is to present findings, within thecontext of the community wide effort to make the training materialsmore FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable."
