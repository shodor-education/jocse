abstract: "In this study, we investigate the performance of several regressionmodels by utilizing a database of dielectric constants. First, thedatabase is processed using the Matminer Python library to createfeatures, and then divided into training, validation, and testingsubsets. We evaluate several models: Linear Regression, RandomForest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression,and Feedforward Neural Network, with the objective of predictingthe bandgap values. The results indicate superior performance oftree-based ensemble models over Linear Regression and SupportVector Regression. Additionally, a Feedforward Neural Networkwith two hidden layers demonstrates comparable proficiency incapturing the relationship between the features generated byMatminer and the bandgap target values."
