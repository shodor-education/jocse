abstract: "Giving students a good understanding how micro-architectural effectsimpact achievable performance of HPC workloads is essentialfor their education. It enables them to find effective optimizationstrategies and to reason about sensible approaches towards betterefficiency. This paper describes a lab course held in collaborationbetween LRZ, LMU, and TUM. The course was born with a dualmotivation in mind: filling a gap in educating students to becomeHPC experts, as well as understanding the stability and usabilityof emerging HPC programming models for recent CPU and GPUarchitectures with the help of students. We describe the coursestructure used to achieve these goals, resources made available toattract students, and experiences and statistics from running thecourse for six semesters. We conclude with an assessment of howsuccessfully the lab course met the initially set vision."
