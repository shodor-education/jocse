abstract: "In the age of advanced open-source artificial intelligence (AI) and a
growing demand for software tools, programming skills are as important
as ever. For even the most experienced programmers, it can
be challenging to determine which software libraries and packages
are best suited to fit specific programming needs. To investigate
the potential of AI-supported learning, this case study explores the
use of OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, powered by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, by students
to create an image annotation graphical user interface (GUI)
in Python. This task was selected because good User Experience
(UX) design is a deceptively complex task in that it can be very
easy to build a GUI interface but extremely hard to build one that
is well designed. The approaches employed in this study included
creating a program from scratch that integrates the listed features
incrementally; compiling a list of essential features and requesting
ChatGPT to modify existing code accordingly; collaborating
on specific segments of a user-initiated program; and creating a
program anew using GPT-4 for comparative analysis. The findings
of this case study indicate that ChatGPT is optimally utilized for responding
to precise queries rather than creating code from scratch.
Effective use of ChatGPT requires a foundational understanding of
programming languages. As a learning tool, ChatGPT can help a
novice programmer create competent initial drafts, akin to what
one might expect from an introductory programming course, yet
they necessitate substantial modifications for deployment of the
tool even as a prototype."
