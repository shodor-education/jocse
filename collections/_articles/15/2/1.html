abstract: "Data science continues to create opportunities in the technology
and HPC industry resulting from growing data sets, the need for
more insights, the necessity of automation, the evolving roles and
changes in job descriptions as those positions are needed and the
shortage in the workforce with this talent. However, despite the
growing demand, not enough students are learning the basic skills
or being able to be given opportunities for hands-on work. In the
Northern California Community College system, many of the students return to school after having graduated with a bachelorâ€™s
degree or find the need to gain new skills to enhance their resume
or to change careers altogether. Unfortunately, in the community
colleges, there are not enough classes or instructors who are trained
in data science to teach the class. In the four-year university, the
program is usually waitlisted for transfer students from the community college. This paper is a continuation of the work after the
National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)
partnered with Laney College to start a Data Analytics program.
After two years, they are challenged with not enough instructors to
the number of students that are interested in the program. Further,
approximately 40% of students are struggling to continue the rigorous material they need to learn. These students may have to work to
support families and are unable to put in the 20-40 hours of work to
earn a living as well as the 20-40 hours of study and homework that
the program requires. Therefore, Laney partnered with Codefinity, an online education program that has a track for Python Data
Analysis and Visualization. "
