abstract: "High-performance computing (HPC) is a crucial field in science and
engineering. Although HPC is often viewed as a pure field of
computer science or a subset of it, it actually serves as a tool that
enables us to achieve exceptional results in science and engineering. Since early on, computers have been primarily utilized for
extensive arithmetic computations. However, recent advancements
in electronics have also made edge computing integral to high-performance computing. Additionally, we have witnessed remark-
able growth in computer architecture, leading to the development
of powerful HPC machines, with supercomputers now reaching
exaflop powers. Nevertheless, there are still challenges in utilizing
these powerful machines due to the lack of knowledge in integrating physics and mathematics into HPC. Furthermore, complications
with the software stack and common parallel programming models
that target exascale computing (heterogeneous computing) persist.
In this context, we present our effective course design for HPC training, focusing on CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP courses, which
aim to equip STEM graduates with HPC knowledge. We also discuss
how our training stands out in comparison to other NCC training
frameworks in the EuroCC context and promotes lifelong learning."
