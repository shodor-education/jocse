abstract: "As training on cyberinfrastructure resources becomes more common, 
we show the progression of metrics used to measure the effectiveness and 
impact of informal computational training courses
that are provided by the Texas A&M University High Performance
Research Computing facility. These courses were built to support
researchers from research groups that have a background in computing practices. 
As such, the courses were structured as information-sharing sessions with 
the primary method to measure course success being frequency of participation.
 While these metrics inform
about the interest in these courses, they relied on researchers continuing 
the learning process in their laboratories. As computing
becomes ubiquitous in research programs, researchers who have no
peer-learning mechanisms participate in these courses. Researchers
are now participating in a continuum of courses that cover introductory 
to advanced topics and rely on them to build proficiency
in research computing technologies.
We report on a pilot program that pivots along the way to support
these researchers."
