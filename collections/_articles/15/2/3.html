abstract: "The new strategic framework of Wake Forest University seeks
to build and strengthen signature areas of excellence in research,
scholarship, and creative work that cross academic and institutional boundaries. To support this initiative, the High Performance
Computing (HPC) Team has developed an Introduction to High Performance Computing undergraduate course that is accessible to
students of all levels and of all academic domains. The objective of
this course is to build a curriculum that presents HPC as an essential
tool for research and scholarship, enables student-faculty collaboration across all disciplines, and promotes student participation in
academic research during their undergraduate studies."
