abstract: "Computation is a significant part of the work done by many practicing
scientists, yet it is not universally taught from a scientific
perspective in undergraduate science departments. In response to
the need to provide training in scientific computation to our students,
we developed a suite of self-paced 'modules' in the form of
Jupyter notebooks using Python. These modules introduce the basics
of Python programming and present a wide variety of scientific
applications of computing, ranging from numerical integration and
differentiation to Fourier analysis, Monte Carlo methods, parallel
processing, and machine learning. 1 The modules contain multiple
features to promote learning, including 'Breakpoint Questions,'
recaps of key information, self-reflection prompts, and exercises."
