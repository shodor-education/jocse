abstract: "General purpose GPUs are a powerful hardware with a number
of applications in the realm of relational databases. We
further extended a database framework designed to allow
for GPU execution queries. Our technique is novel in that
it implements Dynamic Parallelism, a new feature in recent
hardware, to accelerate SQL JOINs. Query execution results
in 1.25X speedup on average with respect to a previous
method, also accelerated by GPUs, which employs a
multi-dimensional CUDA Grid.
More importantly, we divided the queries to run on multiple
BW nodes to investigate the scalability of both SELECT
and JOIN."
