abstract: "Several microbial genome databases provide collections of thousands of genome annotation files in formats suitable for the performance of complex cognitive activities such as decision making, sense making and analytical reasoning. The goal of the research reported in this article was to interactive analytics resources to support the performance of complex cognitive activities on a collection of publicly available genome information spaces. A supercomputing infrastructure (Blue Waters Supercomputer) provided computational tools to construct information spaces while visual analytics software and online bioinformatics resources provided tools to interact with the constructed information spaces. The Rhizobiales order of bacteria that includes the Brucella genus was the use case for preforming the complex cognitive activities. An interesting finding among the genomes of the dolphin pathogen, Brucella ceti, was a cluster of genes with evidence for function in conditions of limited nitrogen availability."
