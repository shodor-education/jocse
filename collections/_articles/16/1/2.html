abstract: "HPC-ED is working to improve discovery and sharing of Cyber-
Training resources through the combination of the HPC-ED CyberTraining
Catalog, an effective and flexible interface, thoughtful
metadata design, and active community participation. HPC-ED
encourages authors to share training resource information while
retaining ownership and allows organizations to enrich their local
portals with shared materials. By basing the architecture on an
established, flexible framework, HPC-ED can provide a range of
solutions people and organizations can employ for sharing and
discovering materials.
In this paper we describe the initial pilot phase of the project,
where we prototyped the HPC-ED catalog, established an initial
metadata set, provided documentation, and began using the system
to share and discover materials. We gathered community feedback
through a variety of means, and are now planning an implementation
phase based on evolving our architecture and tools to meet
community needs and feedback through improved interfaces and
tools designed to address a range of preferences. "
