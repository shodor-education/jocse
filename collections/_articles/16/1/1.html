abstract: "Interest in High-Performance Computing (HPC) has surged, driven
by the demand for skills to utilize advanced computing methods.
These methods include managing vast amounts of data, implementing
complex algorithms, and developing Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications. HPC ecosystems play a crucial role in tackling intricate
scientific and engineering problems. However, integrating
various stakeholders demands a deep understanding of collaboration
and innovation within HPC settings. This proposal explores
how different stakeholders—from students across diverse fields to
scientists and policymakers—have been integrated at various levels.
This integration is facilitated by introducing new formal courses, incorporating
relevant topics into existing curricula, and other related
activities."
