abstract: "This paper proposes a monitoring system that emails feedback
to users about submitted jobs and has the capability to stop and
resubmit jobs to a batch scheduler. The proposed system has been
implemented for a small supercomputing environment with a mix
of high-performance and high-throughput computing jobs. User
feedback includes alerts for over- and under-utilization of CPU
and physical memory. This paper also discusses how predefined
system thresholds were chosen and proposes three algorithms. An
algorithm for the proposed monitoring system and two algorithms
for the prediction of CPU and physical memory utilization. The
latter algorithms are based on users' input of the identification
string (job ID) of a similar job that should have finished execution
without errors. Lastly, a git repository is shared to make the code
accessible for review."
