abstract: "As the capabilities of large language models 
(LLMs) continue to
expand, with more accurate and powerful
models being released
monthly, researchers and educators are increasingly eager to incorporate
these tools into their work. The growing demand for this
technology reflects its transformative potential in natural language
and its impact on scientific research. However, as more users seek
to harness the power of LLMs, the need to provide comprehensive
education and scalable support becomes ever more critical. Our
institution has recognized this challenge and developed a support
framework to educate users through regular educational events,
consultations, and project support. To address the growing need
for LLM support, we have implemented several key strategies, including
deploying Jupyter Lab sessions using Open OnDemand
for seamless HPC access and integrating cloud-based solutions via
Jetstream2. We provide insights into our approach, detailing how
we empower researchers and educators to leverage the capabilities
of LLMs in their diverse applications."
