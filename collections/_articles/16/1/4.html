abstract: "We present a training program named T3-CIDERS, the Train-
The-Trainer approach to fostering cyberinfrastructure (CI)- and
Data-Enabled Research in CyberSecurity. T3-CIDERS is a train-the-trainer
program for advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills that
is designed to be synergistic with research, teaching, and learning
activities in cybersecurity and cyber-related disciplines. The participants,
termed 'future trainers' (FTs), are trained in effective instructional
design and CI hands-on materials from DeapSECURE, developed
in a previous CyberTraining program. T3-CIDERS aims to enhance
cybersecurity research and education through broader adoption
of advanced CI techniques such as artificial intelligence, big
data, parallel programming, and platforms like high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. T3-CIDERS includes pre-training, a
weeklong summer institute, ongoing learning engagements, and
local training activities. The FTs conduct local training tailored
to the needs at their respective home institutions. They will also
develop a new CI training module (called 'Module X') based on the
observed common needs in the cybersecurity research community.
Community building is integral to T3-CIDERS as its overarching
goal. The first cohort of FTs who took the 2024 summer institute
comprises faculty members, researchers, and students representing
multiple states."
