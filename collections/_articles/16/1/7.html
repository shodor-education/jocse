abstract: "The HPC Carpentry project aims to develop highly interactiveworkshop
training materials to empower novices to effectively leverage
HPC to solve scientific and technical problems in their domains.
Modeled after The Carpentries training programs, the project's goal
is to develop foundational HPC skills and a sense of empowerment,
rather than expertise. The workshop setting provides learners with
hands-on experience that elicits confidence working with HPC
systems and provides sufficient vocabulary to make subsequent
self-study more effective.
In a major milestone, the steering committee is leading HPC
Carpentry through the formal incubation process to become an
official Carpentries lesson program alongside the existing Software,
Data, and Library Carpentry programs. This achievement is the
product of significant work over the past several years, incorporating
valuable materials from many contributors. Our most recent
focus has been developing materials for a user workshop.We begin
with an introduction to the command-line shell (using Software
Carpentry's Unix Shell lesson), followed by our Introduction to
HPC lesson, covering remote access and resource management. We
end with a newly developed lesson on HPC workflow management,
which walks learners through the execution of a scaling study on
an HPC system, emphasizing both the benefits and limitations of
the system for domain applications. This workshop program was
recently run in full at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Future plans include building a developer workshop, reconnecting
with disparate contributors, and engaging with the broader
community through regular open conference calls and outreach."
