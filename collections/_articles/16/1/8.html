abstract: "In this paper, we present an educational project aimed to introduce
students to the technology behind Captive Portals infrastructures.
For doing this, we developed a series of modules to emphasize each
of the different aspects and features of this technology. The project
is based on an open source implementation which is widely used
in many computer network courses, making it well-suited and very
appealing for instructors and practitioners in this field."
