abstract: "Despite the quantity of existing training materials, acquisition and
development of the specialist skills required for High Performance
Computing (HPC) is not straightforward enough to address the
needs of the growing, diversifying and constantly evolving HPC
community. The HPC education and training community is exploring
different approaches that could facilitate the uptake and
progression of technical skills - one of those new approaches is
focused on defining and formalising learning pathways. In this
lightning talk we will briefly present an exercise designed as a starting
point for capturing and outlining learning pathways for the
HPC community. This exercise was run for the first time during the
ISC'24 BoF on Developing a Sustainable Future for HPC and RSE
Skills: Training Pathways and Structures, and was accompanied by
a Mentimeter survey to evaluate its effectiveness. The summary of
the survey results is also included."
