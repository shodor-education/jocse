abstract: "In June 2024, the University of Washington's (UW) Clean Energy
Institute (CEI) and Molecular Engineering and Materials Center
(MEMC) in partnership with UW Research Computing (RC) prepared
complimentary training for a group of 25 Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) participants.Workshop participants
had completed zero to four years of post-secondary education and
came from 17 colleges and universities across eight states with
29% currently attending 2-year programs. On average, 14 students
attended a given workshop. The program included four targeted
workshop offerings, spanning essential skills in computational science
and advanced topics: (1) Python via Jupyter, (2) Command
Line Interface (CLI) and high performance computing (HPC), (3)
Gaussian and Quantum Espresso, and (4) data analysis using linear
and logistic regression as well as neural networks. The program's
effectiveness was evaluated with a post-workshop survey. Survey
results indicated most participants had little prior experience in
these topics but indicated the content was relevant for their current
and future aspirations. The survey showed some students agreed
with statements indicating that learning objectives were met, but
overall scores and open responses indicated areas for improvement.
In the future, the CLI and HPC session will be converted from one to
two sessions and the material in the applied Gaussian and Quantum
Espresso demonstrations reduced. The program's materials are reproducible
and publicly accessible, compatible with most academic
HPC clusters. Our program addressed a wide range of training
and education needs within computational science, emphasizing
practical skills and interdisciplinary applicability."
