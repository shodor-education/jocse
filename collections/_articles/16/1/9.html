abstract: "This paper provides an overview of the student HPC Special
Interest Group (SIG) formed at the University of the Witwatersrand
that focuses on delivering HPC training to the undergraduate student
community. The paper outlines the approach towards growing
and maintaining the interest group, including teaching and learning
strategies to prepare Wits students for Student Cluster Competitions.
Insights into the challenges experienced and lessons learned
are discussed, particularly with respect to sustainable workforce
development. These insights could help develop a structured framework
for creating effective and sustainable HPC special interest
groups, centred around student involvement."
