abstract: "High-performance computing (HPC) clusters are powerful tools
that can be used to support a wide range of research projects across
all disciplines. However, HPC clusters can be complex and difficult
to use, limiting their accessibility to researchers without a strong
technical background. This study used a mixed method to investigate
ways to make HPC clusters more accessible to researchers
from all disciplines on a university campus. A usability study of
19 university researchers was conducted to understand the needs
of HPC users and identify areas where user experience could be
improved. Our findings reveal the need to build a customized graphical
user interface HPC management portal to serve users' needs
and invest in workforce development by introducing an academic
credit-based High-Performance Computing Course for students
and partnering with other faculties to introduce special programs,
e.g., Student Cluster Competitions which would draw more student
interest."
