abstract: "SARS-CoV-2 (also known as COVID-19) is a coronavirus that hasrecently emerged and impacted nearly every human on the planet.The nonstructural protein 12 (NSP 12) is an RNA-dependent RNApolymerase that replicates viral RNA in a cell to infect it.Interrupting this function should prohibit the virus from replicatingwithin the body and would decrease the severity of the virus’seffects in patients. The objective of this project is to identifypotential inhibitors for NSP 12 that might be suitable as antiviraldrugs. Thus, we obtained the structure of NSP 12 from RCSB’sprotein data bank. The protein structure was analyzed usingcomputer software (Chimera and PyRx), and ligands obtained fromthe ZINC database and RCSB’s protein data bank were docked toNSP 12. The resulting binding affinities were recorded, and bindinggeometries analyzed."
