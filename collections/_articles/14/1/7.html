abstract: "As more students want to pursue a career in big data analytics anddata science, big data education has become a focal point in manycolleges and universitiesâ€™ curricula. There are many challengeswhen it comes to teaching and learning big data in a classroomsetting. One of the biggest challenges is to prepare big data infrastructureto provide meaningful hands-on experience to students.Setting up necessary distributed computing resource is a delicateact for instructors and system administrators because there is noone size fit all solutions. In this paper, we propose an approachthat facilitates the creation of the computing environment on bothpersonal computers and public cloud resources. This combinedapproach meet different needs and can be used in an educationalsetting to facilitate different big data learning activities. We discussand reflect on our experience using these systems in teachingundergraduate and graduate courses."
