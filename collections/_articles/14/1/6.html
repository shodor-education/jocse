abstract: "Delivering training and education on hybrid technologies (includingAI, ML, GPU, Data and Visual Analytics including VR andQuantum Computing) integrated with HPC resources is key toenable individuals and businesses to take full advantage of digitaltechnologies, hence enhancing processes within organisations andproviding the enabling skills to thrive in a digital economy. Supercomputingcentres focused on solving industry-led problems facethe challenge of having a pool of users with little experience inexecuting simulations on large-scale facilities, as well as limitedknowledge of advanced computational techniques and integratedtechnologies. We aim not only at educating them in using the facilitiesavailable, but to raise awareness of methods which have thepotential to increase their productivity. In this paper, we provideour perspective on how to efficiently train industry users, and howto engage with them about wider digital technologies and howthese, used efficiently together, can benefit their business."
