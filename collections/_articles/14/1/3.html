abstract: "Given the anticipated growth of the high-performance computingmarket, HPC is challenged with expanding the size, diversity,and skill of its workforce while also addressing post-pandemic distributedworkforce protocols and an ever-expanding ecosystem ofarchitectures, accelerators, and software stacks. As we move towardexascale computing, training approaches need to address how tobest prepare future computational scientists and enable establisheddomain researchers to stay current and master tools needed for exascalearchitectures. This paper explores adding hybrid and virtualHackathons to the training mix to bridge traditional programmingcurricula and hands-on skills needed among diverse communities.We outline current learning and development programs available;explain the benefits and challenges in implementing hackathonsfor training using experience gained from the Open Hackathonsprogram (formerly the GPU Hackathons program); discuss howto engage diverse communitiesâ€”from early career researchers toveteran scientists; and recommend best practices for implementingthese events."
