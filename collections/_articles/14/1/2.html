abstract: "The fate and transport of dissolved constituents in porous media hasimportant applications in the earth and environmental sciences andmany engineering disciplines. Mathematical models are commonlyapplied to simulate the movement of substances in porous mediausing the advection-dispersion equation. Whereas computerprograms based on numerical solutions are commonly employed tosolve the governing equations for these problems, analyticalsolutions also exist for some important one-dimensional cases.These solutions are often still quite complex to apply in practice,and therefore computational tools are still needed to apply them todetermine the concentrations of dissolved substances as a functionof space and time. The Python Programming Language provides avariety of tools that enable implementation of analytical solutionsinto useful tools and facilitate their application to experimental data.Python provides an important but underutilized tool in environmentalmodeling courses. This article highlights the developmentof a series of Python-based computing tools that can be used tonumerically compute the values of an analytical solution to the onedimensionaladvection-dispersion equation. These tools are targetedto graduate and advanced undergraduate courses that teachenvironmental modeling and the application of Python forcomputing."
