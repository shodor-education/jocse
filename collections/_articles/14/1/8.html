abstract: "This article gives an overview of ECP's Broadening Participation
Initiative (https://www.exascaleproject.org/hpc-workforce/), which
has the mission of establishing a sustainable plan to recruit and retain
a diverse workforce in the DOE high-performance computing
community by fostering a supportive and inclusive culture within
the computing sciences at DOE national laboratories. We will describe
key activities within three complementary thrusts: establishing
an HPC Workforce Development and Retention Action Group,
creating accessible 'Intro to HPC' training materials, and launching
the Sustainable Research Pathways for High-Performance Computing
(SRP-HPC) workforce development program. We are leveraging
ECP's unique multilab partnership to work toward sustainable collaboration
across the DOE community, with the long-term goal of changing the 
culture and demographic profile of DOE computing sciences."
