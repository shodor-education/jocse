abstract: "We propose a modified MSA algorithm on quantum annealers withapplications in areas of bioinformatics and genetic sequencing. Tounderstand the human genome, researchers compare extensive setsof these genetic sequences – or their protein counterparts – toidentify patterns. This comparison begins with the alignment ofthe set of (multiple) sequences. However, this alignment problemis considered nondeterministically-polynomial time complete and,thus, current classical algorithms at best rely on brute force orheuristic methods to find solutions. Quantum annealing algorithmsare able to bypass this need for sheer brute force due to their useof quantum mechanical properties. However, due to the novelty ofthese algorithms, many are rudimentary in nature and limited byhardware restrictions. We apply progressive alignment techniquesto modify annealing algorithms, achieving a linear reduction inspin usage whilst introducing more complex heuristics to the algorithm.This opens the door for further exploration into quantumcomputing-based bioinformatics, potentially allowing for a deeperunderstanding of disease detection and monitoring."
