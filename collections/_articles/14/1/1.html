abstract: "Expanded articulation of demonstrable competencies and a
burgeoning demand for security analysts increasingly responsive to
rapidly evolving conditions have brought to foreground a need to
revamp core curriculum in the area. Once such effort has emerged
at one university where a faculty member in computer engineering
technology, network communications, and computer science has
developed a novel pedagogical strategy that teaches network
security through protocol behavior and trust point observations.
This paper used a single course case study to explore the
engagement patterns of learning associated with this novel
curricular approach to learning secure design of networks. This
exploratory study's findings lay important foundation for
understanding the ways in which students are making use of
multiple forms of experiential engagement. While homework
exercises, perhaps conceptually the most traditional form of
engagement, were accessed largely at a one opportunity per student
count, practices and much more importantly labs were used in much
more frequent ways. In particular, labs display a positive
engagement pattern in that they demonstrate students' choices to
access early and in a sustained variety of topics. Importantly, these
opportunities are active in their mechanism for learning, which
connects with a strategy previous empirical literature has positively
reinforced."
