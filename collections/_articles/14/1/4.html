abstract: "Researchers and developers in a variety of fields have benefited
from the massively parallel processing paradigm. Numerous tasks
are facilitated by the use of accelerated computing, such as graphics,
simulations, visualisations, cryptography, data science, and 
machine learning. Over the past years, machine learning and in
particular deep learning have received much attention. The development
of such solutions requires a different level of expertise
and insight than that required for traditional software engineering.
Therefore, there is a need for novel approaches to teaching people
about these topics. This paper outlines the primary challenges of
accelerated computing and deep learning education, discusses the
methodology and content of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute,
presents the results of a quantitative survey conducted after full-day
workshops, and demonstrates a sample adoption of DLI teaching
kits for teaching heterogeneous parallel computing."
