abstract: "Today's job market has its challenges in gaining proficient staffbut more so in the High Performance Computing area and withina government lab. Competition from industry in terms of the typeof perks they provide, being able to negotiate a higher salary andopportunities of remote work all play a part in losing candidates.At the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center(NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), asite reliability engineer manages the data center onsite 24x7.Further, the facility itself is a unique and complex ecosystem thatuses evaporative cooling and recycling of hot air to keep thefacility cool. This is in addition to the normal areas to bemonitored like the computational systems, the three tier storage,as well as infrastructure and cybersecurity.To explore creating interest into HPC and STEM within thedisadvantaged communities near the Laboratory, NERSCpartnered with a community college during the pandemic tosupport high school seniors and freshmen students to provide aneducational foundation. In collaboration with the communitycollege, they created a program of specific classes that studentsneeded to take to prepare them for an HPC and/or STEMinternships. In certain demographics, students do not believe theycan be successful in science or math and require support from theprogram such as tutors to help them through. With this type ofsupport, students have successfully completed their classes withpassing grades.As part of their recruitment process for site reliabilityengineers to continue to support diversity initiatives at theLaboratory, NERSC implemented an apprenticeship program.This paper describes the current work that includes partneringwith a community college program and then NERSC provides asummer internship for the student so they can gain hands-onexperience. The first cohort of students have graduated into theirinternship programs this summer. This paper demonstrates earlyresults from this partnership and how it has impacted the diversepool of candidates at NERSC."
