abstract: "In response to an increasing demand for digital skills in industry andacademia, a series of credentialed short courses that cover a varietyof topics related to high performance computing were designedand implemented to enable university students and researchersto effectively utilize research computing resources and bridge thegap for users with educational backgrounds that do not includecomputational training. The courses cover a diverse array of topics,including subjects in programming, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence/machine learning, bioinformatics, and cloud computing. Thecourses are designed to enable the students to apply the skills theylearn to their own research that incorporates use of large-scale computingsystems. These courses offer advantages to generic onlinecourses in that they teach computing skills relevant to academicresearch programs. Finally, the micro-credentials obtained fromthese courses are transcriptable, may be stacked with existing degreeprograms and credit-bearing courses to create a larger degreeplan, and offer a meaningful mechanism of adding to a student'sresume."
