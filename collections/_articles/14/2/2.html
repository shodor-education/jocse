abstract: "Computing programs for secondary school students are rapidly becominga staple at High Performance Computing (HPC) centers andComputer Science departments around the country. Developingcurriculum that targets specific computing subfields with unmetneeds remains a challenge. Here, we report on developments in thetwo week Summer Computing Academy (SCA) to focus on two suchsubfields. During the first week, 'Computing for a Better Tomorrow:Data Sciences,' introduced students to real-life applications ofbig data processing. A variety of topics were covered, including genomicsand bioinformatics, cloud computing, and machine learning.During the second week, 'Camp Secure: Cybersecurity,' focused onissues related to principles of cybersecurity. Students were taughtonline safety, cryptography, and internet structure. The two weeksare unified by a common thread of Python programming. Modulesfrom the SCA program may be implemented at other institutionswith relative ease and promote cybertraining efforts nationwide."
