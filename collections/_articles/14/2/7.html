abstract: "A joint proof-of-concept project between Arizona State Universityand CR8DL, Inc., deployed a Jupyter-notebook based interface todatacenter resources for a computationally intensive, semesterlengthbiochemistry course project. Facilitated for undergraduatebiochemistry students with limited high-performance computingexperience, the straightforward interface allowed for large scalecomputations. As the project progressed, various enhancementswere identified and implemented."
