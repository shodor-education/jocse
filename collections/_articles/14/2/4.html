abstract: "This paper shares the results of a survey conducted October-November 2022. The survey's intent was to learn how thecommunity both shares and discovers training and educationmaterials, whether those needs were being met, and if there wereinterest in improving how materials are shared. The survey resultedin 112 responses primarily from content authors who are, orsupport, academics. While the majority of respondents consideredthemselves successful in finding materials, most also encounteredbarriers, such as finding materials, but not at the needed depth orlevel. Most respondents were both interested in, and able to, worktoward community efforts to improve finding materials, with mostciting lack of staff time as a barrier to doing so. Proposed effortsin community engagement to work toward these efforts arediscussed."
