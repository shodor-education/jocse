abstract: "The challenges of HPC education span a wide array of targetedapplications, ranging from developing a new generation of administratorsand facilitators to maintain and support cluster resourcesand their respective user communities, to broadening the impact ofHPC workflows by reaching non-traditional disciplines and trainingresearchers in the best-practice tools and approaches when usingsuch systems. Furthermore, standard x86 and GPU architecturesare becoming untenable to scale to the needs of computationalresearch, necessitating software and hardware co-development onless-familiar processors. While platforms such as Cerebras andSambaNova have matured to include common frameworks suchas TensorFlow and PyTorch as well as robust APIs, and thus areamenable to production use cases and instructional material, othersystems may lack such infrastructure maturity, impeding all but themost technically inclined developers from being able to leveragethe system.
We present here our efforts and outcomes of providing a codevelopmentand instructional platform for the Lucata Pathfinderthread-migratory system in the Rogues Gallery at Georgia Tech.Through a collection of user workflow management, co-developmentwith the platformâ€™s engineers, community tutorials, undergraduatecoursework, and student hires, we have been able to explore multiplefacets of HPC education in a unique way that can serve as aviable template for others seeking to develop similar efforts."
