abstract: "End users of remote computing systems are frequently not aware ofbasic ways in which they could enhance protection against cyberthreatsand attacks. In this paper, we discuss specific techniquesto help and train users to improve cybersecurity when using suchsystems. To explain the rationale behind these techniques, we gointo some depth explaining possible threats in the context of usingremote, shared computing resources. Although some of the detailsof these prescriptions and recommendations apply to specific usecases when connecting to remote servers, such as a supercomputer,cluster, or Linux workstation, the main concepts and ideas can beapplied to a wider spectrum of cases."
