abstract: "Complex scientific codes and the datasets they generate are in need
    of a sophisticated categorization environment that allows the community to
    store, search, and enhance metadata in an open, dynamic system.
    Currently, data is often presented in a read-only format,
    distilled and curated by a select group of researchers. We envision
    a more open and dynamic system, where authors can publish their
    data in a writeable format, allowing users to annotate the
    datasets with their own comments and data. This would enable the
    scientific community to collaborate on a higher level than before,
    where researchers could for example annotate a published dataset with
    their citations.

    Such a system would require a complete set of permissions to
    ensure that any individual's data cannot be altered by others unless
    they specifically allow it. For this reason datasets and codes are
    generally presented read-only, to protect the author's data; however,
    this also prevents the type of social revolutions that the private
    sector has seen with Facebook and Twitter.

    In this paper, we present an alternative method of publishing codes
    and datasets, based on Fluidinfo,
    which is an openly writeable and social metadata engine. We will
    use the specific example of the Einstein Toolkit, a part of the Cactus
    Framework, to illustrate how the code's metadata may be published in 
    writeable form via Fluidinfo."
