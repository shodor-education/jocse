abstract: "The Blue Waters Fellowship program supported by the National Science Foundation focused on supporting PhD candidates requiring access to high performance computing resources to advance their computational and data-enabled research. The program was designed to strengthen the workforce engaged in computational research. As the program developed, a number of modifications were made to improve the experience of the fellows and promote their success. We review the program, its evolution, and the impacts it had on the participants. We then discuss how the lessons learned from those efforts can be applied to future educational efforts."
